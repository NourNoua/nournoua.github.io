							<h2>Some Insight on who I am</h2>
							<p>Greetings! I would like to share some of my interests and hobbies. And how I generally like to spend my time so that you can get to know me a little better. I enjoy a range of activities from drawing, playing the piano, fixing computers, hiking and gaming. I have recently started reading and am currently finishing fahrenheit 451. I like to listen to electronic music, alternative rock and some indie or lofi whilst on the tube :). And I aspire to contribute my knowledge to the embetterment of society through developing new technology that can make palpable change!</p>
